# selenium.testproject.examples.templates

This is a template project for Selenium tests, I want to create a reusable resource project for my own work and to help others get started with Selenium testing.

# Goals I am aiming for:
- [ ] Create a reusable project that can be used as a template for Selenium tests
- [ ] Have drivers for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- [ ] Have drivers for remote and local testing
- [ ] Have a way to run tests in parallel
- [ ] Have a way to run tests in a CI/CD pipeline

# How to use this project:
Currently, this project is a work in progress and is not ready for use. I will update this README when the project is ready for use.
